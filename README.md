# SkreynLogger
###### Key and screen logger in Python which periodically sends the logs to your email

Script that logs keystrokes and takes periodic screenshots before sending them to your email address
It is capable of saving the logs locally, but in the current version it cleans them up after sending

Special keys are beautified in the logs (such as ALT, CTRL, ENTER, etc...)

Logs and emails come with a timestamp
